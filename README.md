# Notebooks

I am currently working as a Data Engineer for a company that has chosen to leverage Microsoft Fabric as it's Business Intelligence platform.  I have been transitioning to Fabric Notebooks for my ETL scripting.  I have, for several years, been using an on-premise Jupyter Hub for my team's scripting with crontab jobs to schedule executions.  The files I have uploaded are in Python format (.py) as the Fabric .ipynb files do not open/render in GitHub.

I have been working as an IT systems administer for the better part of my 30 year career with experience in SQL server administration (SQL) and limited scripting with PHP and a LAMP server.  In 2020, I transitioned my career to Data and Analytics and was responsible for planning and rolling out a PowerBI pro solution for my company.  We took the leap to Fabric and upgraded our Microsoft Tennant to an Enterprise / Fabric solution to better serve our stakeholders.  I have obtained my Microsoft Fabric Analytics Engineer certification (it was a Data Engineer Beta cert at the time).  My skillset has tranitioned to the Fabric ecosystem and I have embraced the PySpark / Python languages.  I'm not a coder, and have never claimed to be.  My coding skills are self-taught and not always "Pythonic".  I'm more of a "Git 'er Done" kind of coder.  Please don't critique the code contained here.  Feel free to reach out at bpmcconkey@yahoo.com if you have any questions.

I am using this repo to store notebooks I have authored.
